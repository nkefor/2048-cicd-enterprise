## **Enhanced Version (115 seconds) - RECOMMENDED**

Thanks for speaking with me today. I'm really excited about what Mambu is building.

I bring nine years of cloud platform engineering with a differentiator that's increasingly valuable—I integrate AI into infrastructure automation and compliance. I built a system using LLMs to analyze AWS Config rules and CloudTrail logs, automatically identifying compliance drift and generating remediation steps. That reduced our audit prep time by 40% and provides predictive alerts for cost and security anomalies before they become incidents.

At Tambena, deployment times were slow and security reviews created bottlenecks. I redesigned our CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Terraform, embedding automated security scans and compliance verification directly into each deployment. The result—50% faster deployments while strengthening our security posture. The team shifted from manual, high-stress releases to a fully automated process they could trust.

**What I learned is that the best platform engineering isn't about the fanciest tools—it's about understanding developer psychology. When developers trust your platform catches issues before production, they actually move faster because they're not second-guessing themselves. That shift from 'the platform is a bottleneck' to 'the platform is my safety net' is what I optimize for.**

I'm drawn to Mambu because you're solving something I care about deeply—financial inclusion. Coming from Cameroon, I've seen firsthand how traditional banking systems exclude billions of people. What excites me is how you've scaled from serving microfinance institutions to now empowering 260+ customers and 114 million end-users globally—from fintechs to top-tier banks. Your composable, cloud-native platform approach to democratizing banking technology isn't just innovative, it's necessary.

**I've been thinking about the platform engineering challenges at your scale. Managing deployment velocity across 260+ customers while maintaining compliance across different regulatory jurisdictions—GDPR in Europe, data residency in APAC, varying financial regulations—that's not just technical, it's an orchestration challenge. Balancing 'move fast for fintechs who want weekly releases' versus 'maintain security for tier-one banks' is exactly the tension I find exciting.**

**What you'll get with me is someone who thinks beyond traditional DevOps. I've built production systems on AWS using EKS, Lambda, and Infrastructure as Code. I'm currently experimenting with eBPF for zero-instrumentation observability and exploring Crossplane for multi-tenant self-service infrastructure—both directly relevant to platform challenges at Mambu's scale. I view platform engineering as enabling developers to ship faster while maintaining security, and I know that only works when the platform team is seen as enablers, not gatekeepers.**

**I want to bring this mindset to Mambu—building platform infrastructure that's rock-solid, secure, and continuously improving. I'm curious—what's the platform engineering challenge keeping your team up at night right now?**

## **Remember to:**

### PAUSE after:
- "40%" (1 second)
- "50% faster" (1 second)
- **"safety net"** (1 second) ← NEW! Let this insight land
- "it's necessary" (2 seconds) ← Most important pause
- **"orchestration challenge"** (1 second) ← NEW! Shows strategic thinking
- **Final question** (pause, eye contact, invite response) ← NEW!

### EMPHASIZE (in bold in script above):
- "integrating AI"
- "50% faster"
- **"safety net, not a bottleneck"** ← NEW! Your unique insight
- "Coming from Cameroon"
- **"orchestration challenge"** ← NEW! Strategic thinking
- **"eBPF... Crossplane"** ← NEW! Continuous learning
- **"enablers, not gatekeepers"** ← NEW! Team mindset
- **"keeping your team up at night"** ← NEW! Dialogue transition

### SLOW DOWN at:
- **The psychology insight** ("safety net vs bottleneck") ← NEW!
- The Cameroon/financial inclusion section
- **The orchestration challenge section** ← NEW!
- Make eye contact during all three

### SMILE/BODY LANGUAGE:
- Lean forward slightly at "integrating AI"
- **Pause thoughtfully at "safety net"** ← NEW!
- Direct eye contact at "Coming from Cameroon"
- **Lean forward at "orchestration challenge"** ← NEW!
- **Confident (not showing off) at "eBPF/Crossplane"** ← NEW!
- **Lean back slightly, open posture for final question** ← NEW!

## **If Asked Follow-ups:**

**"Tell me about the AI system"**
→ GPT-4 analyzes AWS Config + CloudTrail → compares to SOC2/ISO27001 → generates remediation steps → 3 weeks to 2 weeks

**"How did you handle resistance?"**
→ Brought security team into design early → showed SAST/DAST at every stage → built break-glass process → they became advocates

**"What do you mean by 'safety net vs bottleneck'?"** (NEW)
→ When devs see platform as bottleneck, they work around it → When they see it as safety net (catches issues, provides guardrails without slowing down), they lean into it → Tambena: deployment frequency ↑, incident rate ↓ → That psychological shift is what I design for

**"Tell me about eBPF/Crossplane"** (NEW)
→ eBPF: Deep observability without instrumenting apps—critical for 260+ customers with different tech stacks → Crossplane: Self-service infra through K8s CRDs with centralized governance → Both solve "autonomy with control" problem at scale

**"What makes you think we have that orchestration challenge?"** (NEW)
→ "I could be wrong—I'd love to hear what you're actually facing. But serving neo-banks (deploy 3x/week) + tier-one banks (quarterly releases) on same platform seems like interesting tension. Is that accurate?"

**"Why Mambu?"**
→ (1) Composable, cloud-native SaaS platform for core banking, lending, deposits, payments—requires rock-solid platform engineering (2) You've scaled from microfinance to 260+ customers, 114M end-users globally—real impact (3) Complex platform challenges at scale—multi-tenancy, compliance, high availability

**"What would you do first 90 days?"** (NEW)
→ Days 1-30: Listen/learn → embed with teams, review metrics → Days 30-60: Identify one high-impact win → Days 60-90: Deliver that win, build trust → Then ready for bigger initiatives
