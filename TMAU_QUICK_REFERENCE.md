## **The 90-Second Script (Clean)**

Thanks for speaking with me today. I'm really excited about what Mambu is building.

I bring nine years of cloud platform engineering with a differentiator that's increasingly valuable—I integrate AI into infrastructure automation and compliance. I built a system using LLMs to analyze AWS Config rules and CloudTrail logs, automatically identifying compliance drift and generating remediation steps. That reduced our audit prep time by 40% and provides predictive alerts for cost and security anomalies before they become incidents.

At Tambena, deployment times were slow and security reviews created bottlenecks. I redesigned our CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Terraform, embedding automated security scans and compliance verification directly into each deployment. The result—50% faster deployments while strengthening our security posture. The team shifted from manual, high-stress releases to a fully automated process they could trust.

I'm drawn to Mambu because you're solving something I care about deeply—financial inclusion. Coming from Cameroon, I've seen firsthand how traditional banking systems exclude billions of people. What excites me is how you've scaled from serving microfinance institutions to now empowering 260+ customers and 114 million end-users globally—from fintechs to top-tier banks. Your composable, cloud-native platform approach to democratizing banking technology isn't just innovative, it's necessary.

My healthcare IT background taught me how to navigate strict regulatory environments like HIPAA while maintaining velocity—exactly what fintech demands.

What you'll get with me is someone who thinks beyond traditional DevOps. I've built production systems on AWS using EKS, Lambda, and Infrastructure as Code. I view platform engineering as enabling developers to ship faster while maintaining security and reliability. I led a cost optimization project that saved over $10K annually through intelligent automation.

I want to bring this mindset to Mambu—building platform infrastructure that's rock-solid, secure, and continuously improving.

## **Remember to:**

### PAUSE after:
- "40%" (1 second)
- "50% faster" (1 second)
- "$10K annually" (1 second)
- "it's necessary" (2 seconds) ← Most important pause

### EMPHASIZE:
- "integrating AI"
- "50% faster"
- "Coming from Cameroon"
- "rock-solid, secure, continuously improving"

### SLOW DOWN at:
- The Cameroon/financial inclusion section
- Make eye contact here

### SMILE when saying:
- "rock-solid, secure"
- Shows confidence, not arrogance

## **If Asked Follow-ups:**

**"Tell me about the AI system"**
→ GPT-4 analyzes AWS Config + CloudTrail → compares to SOC2/ISO27001 → generates remediation steps → 3 weeks to 2 weeks

**"How did you handle resistance?"**
→ Brought security team into design early → showed SAST/DAST at every stage → built break-glass process → they became advocates

**"Why Mambu?"**
→ (1) Composable, cloud-native SaaS platform for core banking, lending, deposits, payments—requires rock-solid platform engineering (2) You've scaled from microfinance to 260+ customers, 114M end-users globally—real impact (3) Complex platform challenges at scale—multi-tenancy, compliance, high availability
