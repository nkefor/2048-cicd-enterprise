## ENHANCED VERSION (115 seconds) - RECOMMENDED

Thanks for speaking with me today. I'm really excited about what Mambu is building.

I bring nine years of cloud platform engineering with a differentiator that's increasingly valuable—I integrate AI into infrastructure automation and compliance. I built a system using LLMs to analyze AWS Config rules and CloudTrail logs, automatically identifying compliance drift and generating remediation steps. That reduced our audit prep time by 40% and provides predictive alerts for cost and security anomalies before they become incidents.

At Tambena, deployment times were slow and security reviews created bottlenecks. I redesigned our CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Terraform, embedding automated security scans and compliance verification directly into each deployment. The result—50% faster deployments while strengthening our security posture. The team shifted from manual, high-stress releases to a fully automated process they could trust.

**What I learned is that the best platform engineering isn't about the fanciest tools—it's about understanding developer psychology. When developers trust your platform catches issues before production, they actually move faster because they're not second-guessing themselves. That shift from 'the platform is a bottleneck' to 'the platform is my safety net' is what I optimize for.**

I'm drawn to Mambu because you're solving something I care about deeply—financial inclusion. Coming from Cameroon, I've seen firsthand how traditional banking systems exclude billions of people. What excites me is how you've scaled from serving microfinance institutions to now empowering 260+ customers and 114 million end-users globally—from fintechs to top-tier banks. Your composable, cloud-native platform approach to democratizing banking technology isn't just innovative, it's necessary.

**I've been thinking about the platform engineering challenges at your scale. Managing deployment velocity across 260+ customers while maintaining compliance across different regulatory jurisdictions—GDPR in Europe, data residency in APAC, varying financial regulations—that's not just technical, it's an orchestration challenge. Balancing 'move fast for fintechs who want weekly releases' versus 'maintain security for tier-one banks' is exactly the tension I find exciting.**

**What you'll get with me is someone who thinks beyond traditional DevOps. I've built production systems on AWS using EKS, Lambda, and Infrastructure as Code. I'm currently experimenting with eBPF for zero-instrumentation observability and exploring Crossplane for multi-tenant self-service infrastructure—both directly relevant to platform challenges at Mambu's scale. I view platform engineering as enabling developers to ship faster while maintaining security, and I know that only works when the platform team is seen as enablers, not gatekeepers.**

**I want to bring this mindset to Mambu—building platform infrastructure that's rock-solid, secure, and continuously improving. I'm curious—what's the platform engineering challenge keeping your team up at night right now?**

## COMMON FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS & RESPONSES

### "Tell me more about the AI compliance system"

"Absolutely. We were spending weeks preparing for audits—manually reviewing IAM policies, S3 bucket configurations, encryption settings. I built a system that uses GPT-4 to analyze our AWS Config snapshots and CloudTrail logs, comparing them against our internal compliance policies and frameworks like SOC 2 and ISO 27001. It generates a detailed report with specific remediation steps—for example, 'S3 bucket X has public read access, recommend applying policy Y.' It's cut our audit prep from 3 weeks to under 2 weeks, and the auditors actually trust the output because it cites specific AWS Config rules."

### "What do you mean by 'safety net vs bottleneck'?"

"When developers see the platform as a bottleneck, they try to work around it—shadow IT, manual deployments, shortcuts. But when they see it as a safety net—something that catches issues before production, provides guardrails without slowing them down—they actually lean into it. They deploy more confidently and more frequently. At Tambena, once developers trusted the automated security scans would catch issues they might miss, they stopped second-guessing every deployment. Our deployment frequency actually increased while our incident rate decreased. That psychological shift is what I design for."

### "Tell me about eBPF and Crossplane—why those specifically?"

"They both address challenges I imagine Mambu faces. eBPF allows deep observability without instrumenting every application—critical when you're running infrastructure for 260+ customers with different tech stacks. You can't ask every customer to modify their code for observability. Crossplane addresses self-service infrastructure in a multi-tenant environment—teams can provision what they need through Kubernetes CRDs while you maintain centralized governance and cost controls. Both solve the 'how do we give teams autonomy while maintaining control' problem that platform engineering at scale requires."

### "How did you handle resistance to the CI/CD changes?"

"Great question. Initially, the security team was concerned we were moving too fast. I brought them into the design process early—showed them how we were embedding SAST scanning, DAST testing, and compliance checks at every stage. I also built a 'break-glass' process so they could still do manual reviews for high-risk changes. Once they saw the pipeline catch issues earlier than they ever did manually, they became advocates."

### "What makes you think we have that orchestration challenge?"

"I could be wrong—I'd love to hear what you're actually facing. But from the outside, serving both neo-banks who need to move fast and tier-one banks with strict compliance requirements on the same platform seems like it would create interesting tensions. One customer wants to deploy three times a week, another wants quarterly release cycles with extensive testing. Both need to be right for their context. That's not a technical problem you can just engineer away—it's about platform design that accommodates both models. Is that accurate, or are the challenges different?"

### "Why Mambu specifically?"

"Three reasons. First, your SaaS platform approach to banking infrastructure is exactly where I think the industry needs to go—composable, cloud-native, API-first. You're providing core banking, lending, deposits, and payment solutions that are agile and designed for rapid deployment. That requires rock-solid platform engineering. Second, financial inclusion is personal to me. The fact that you started with microfinance institutions and now serve 260+ customers globally—from fintechs and telcos to top-tier banks—reaching 114 million end-users, shows you're making real impact at scale. And third, from researching your engineering culture, I can see you're solving complex platform challenges—multi-tenancy, compliance across jurisdictions, high availability—those are problems I've solved and want to keep solving."

### "What would you do in your first 90 days?"

"Three phases. First 30 days: Listen and learn. I'd embed with engineering teams, attend standups, understand pain points firsthand. I'd review deployment metrics, incident reports, and talk to the platform team about what's working and what's not. Days 30-60: Identify one high-impact automation opportunity—maybe improving rollback confidence, maybe streamlining compliance checks for new integrations—something that demonstrates value while I'm still learning your systems. Days 60-90: Deliver that win and build trust. Then I'd be ready to tackle bigger initiatives with credibility and context. The key is building relationships and understanding before proposing solutions."

## HANDLING THEIR RESPONSE TO YOUR FINAL QUESTION

After you ask "What's the platform engineering challenge keeping your team up at night right now?", here's how to respond:

### If They Share a Specific Problem

**DO:**
- Listen actively (nod, maintain eye contact)
- Ask clarifying questions to show genuine interest
- Connect to your experience if relevant
- Offer a thoughtful observation (not a full solution)

**DON'T:**
- Jump immediately to "here's how I'd solve it" (too presumptuous)
- Say "that's easy" or minimize the problem
- Interrupt them while explaining

**Example:** "That's fascinating—the multi-region compliance challenge with data residency. At Tambena, we dealt with HIPAA compliance across multiple states, but I imagine adding GDPR and APAC requirements multiplies the complexity significantly. How are you currently handling the balance between data locality and operational efficiency?"

### If They Deflect ("Everything's Fine")

**Response:** "That's great to hear. What about on the innovation side—are there any new platform capabilities the team is excited about building in the next 6-12 months?"

### If They Turn It Back to You

**Their question:** "Well, what do YOU think our biggest challenge is?"

**Your response:** "Based on my research and what I shared earlier—the orchestration challenge of serving diverse customer needs at scale—I'd be curious if that resonates. But I'm sure there are internal challenges I wouldn't see from the outside. What's top of mind for you?"
