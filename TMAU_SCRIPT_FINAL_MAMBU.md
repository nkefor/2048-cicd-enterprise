# Final TMAU Script - Mambu Platform Engineer Position
**Speaker:** Hansen Nkefor
**Length:** 90 seconds
**Version:** Optimized with Recommendations

## **The Script**

*"Thanks for speaking with me today. I'm really excited about what Mambu is building.*

*I bring nine years of cloud platform engineering with a differentiator that's increasingly valuable—I integrate AI into infrastructure automation and compliance. I built a system using LLMs to analyze AWS Config rules and CloudTrail logs, automatically identifying compliance drift and generating remediation steps. That reduced our audit prep time by 40% and provides predictive alerts for cost and security anomalies before they become incidents.*

*At Tambena, deployment times were slow and security reviews created bottlenecks. I redesigned our CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Terraform, embedding automated security scans and compliance verification directly into each deployment. The result—50% faster deployments while strengthening our security posture. The team shifted from manual, high-stress releases to a fully automated process they could trust.*

*I'm drawn to Mambu because you're solving something I care about deeply—financial inclusion. Coming from Cameroon, I've seen firsthand how traditional banking systems exclude billions of people. Your SaaS platform approach to democratizing banking technology isn't just innovative, it's necessary.*

*My healthcare IT background taught me how to navigate strict regulatory environments like HIPAA while maintaining velocity—exactly what fintech demands.*

*What you'll get with me is someone who thinks beyond traditional DevOps. I've built production systems on AWS using EKS, Lambda, and Infrastructure as Code. I view platform engineering as enabling developers to ship faster while maintaining security and reliability. I led a cost optimization project that saved over $10K annually through intelligent automation.*

*I want to bring this mindset to Mambu—building platform infrastructure that's rock-solid, secure, and continuously improving."*

## **Delivery Guidelines**

### **Pacing & Pauses**

1. **After "40%"** → Pause 1 second (let it land)
2. **After "50% faster deployments"** → Pause 1 second
3. **After "$10K annually"** → Pause 1 second
4. **After "it's necessary"** → Pause 2 seconds (most emotional moment)

### **Emphasis Points**

| **Section** | **What to Emphasize** | **Why** |
|-------------|----------------------|---------|
| Opening | "**integrating AI**" | Differentiator |
| Use Case | "**50% faster**" | Key metric |
| Motivation | "**Coming from Cameroon**" | Authenticity |
| Closing | "**rock-solid, secure, continuously improving**" | Confidence |

### **Tone by Section**

- **Opening (0-20s):** Confident, energetic
- **Use Case (20-40s):** Problem-solver, analytical
- **Motivation (40-60s):** Authentic, passionate (slow down here)
- **Closing (60-90s):** Confident, future-focused

### **Body Language**

- **"Integrating AI"** → Lean forward slightly (shows enthusiasm)
- **"Coming from Cameroon"** → Direct eye contact (shows authenticity)
- **"Rock-solid, secure"** → Smile confidently (not arrogant)
- **Throughout:** Open posture, hands visible

## **Practice Checklist**

### **Before Interview:**
- [ ] Record yourself 3 times, watch for:
  - Filler words ("um", "like", "you know")
  - Speaking too fast (especially the Cameroon section)
  - Rushing through metrics
- [ ] Time yourself—should be 85-90 seconds
- [ ] Practice with someone who doesn't know your background (do they understand it?)
- [ ] Test in front of a mirror (check facial expressions)

### **Day Of:**
- [ ] Review script 2 hours before (not right before—you'll sound robotic)
- [ ] Do vocal warm-ups (hum, tongue twisters)
- [ ] Remind yourself: "This is a conversation, not a performance"

## **Situational Adaptations**

### **If They Seem Technical-Focused:**
**Expand this section:**
> "I've built production systems on AWS—EKS for container orchestration, Lambda for event-driven automation, Terraform for Infrastructure as Code, and a full observability stack using CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Grafana."

### **If They Seem Mission-Focused:**
**Expand this section:**
> "Coming from Cameroon, I've seen how lack of access to financial services keeps people trapped in poverty. When I learned about Mambu's work enabling neo-banks and microfinance institutions, it felt like the technical work I do could actually change lives—that's rare and powerful."

### **If Time is Tight (60 seconds):**
**Cut these sections:**
1. Healthcare IT sentence (remove entirely)
2. Shorten tech stack: "I've built production systems on AWS using EKS, Lambda, and Infrastructure as Code."

### **If They Interrupt with Questions:**
**Don't panic. Common interruptions:**
- **"Tell me more about the AI system"** → Great! They're interested. Dive deeper.
- **"What was the Tambena tech stack?"** → Answer directly, then ask: "Should I continue or would you like to dive deeper here?"
- **"Where in Cameroon?"** → Answer warmly, show personality, then transition back: "That background is actually why I'm so excited about Mambu's mission..."

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

| **Mistake** | **Why It Hurts** | **Fix** |
|-------------|------------------|---------|
| Speaking too fast | They can't absorb information | Pause after each metric |
| Sounding scripted | Seems inauthentic | Vary your wording slightly each practice |
| Over-explaining AI | Loses non-technical interviewers | Keep it at current level unless asked |
| Underselling Cameroon story | This is your most memorable part | Slow down, make eye contact |
| Ending weakly | Last impression matters | Deliver "rock-solid, secure, continuously improving" with confidence |

## **Post-Script Transitions**

After you finish, expect these follow-up questions:

### **"Tell me more about the AI compliance system"**
**Response:**
"Absolutely. We were spending weeks preparing for audits—manually reviewing IAM policies, S3 bucket configurations, encryption settings. I built a system that uses GPT-4 to analyze our AWS Config snapshots and CloudTrail logs, comparing them against our internal compliance policies and frameworks like SOC 2 and ISO 27001. It generates a detailed report with specific remediation steps—for example, 'S3 bucket X has public read access, recommend applying policy Y.' It's cut our audit prep from 3 weeks to under 2 weeks, and the auditors actually trust the output because it cites specific AWS Config rules."

### **"How did you handle resistance to the CI/CD changes?"**
**Response:**
"Great question. Initially, the security team was concerned we were moving too fast. I brought them into the design process early—showed them how we were embedding SAST scanning, DAST testing, and compliance checks at every stage. I also built a 'break-glass' process so they could still do manual reviews for high-risk changes. Once they saw the pipeline catch issues earlier than they ever did manually, they became advocates."

### **"Why Mambu specifically?"**
**Response:**
"Three reasons. First, your SaaS platform approach to banking infrastructure is exactly where I think the industry needs to go—composable, cloud-native, API-first. Second, financial inclusion is personal to me. And third, from researching your tech blog and engineering culture, I can see you're solving complex platform challenges at scale—multi-tenancy, compliance across jurisdictions, high availability—those are problems I've solved and want to keep solving."

## **Success Metrics**

You'll know this script is working if:
- ✅ They ask follow-up questions about the AI system
- ✅ They engage with your Cameroon story emotionally
- ✅ They smile or nod when you mention specific metrics
- ✅ They transition directly to technical deep-dives
- ✅ They say something like: "That's a really interesting background"

## **Final Confidence Boosters**

1. **You have a unique story.** Not many platform engineers have your combination of AI integration + regulatory experience + authentic mission alignment.

2. **Your metrics are real.** 40%, 50%, $10K—these aren't inflated, they're defensible.

3. **You've prepared.** The fact that you're reading this means you're more prepared than 90% of candidates.

4. **This is a conversation.** If you forget a line, just have a conversation. They want to know you, not hear a perfect recitation.

5. **You belong here.** You have 9 years of experience, you've solved real problems, and you care about the mission. That's exactly what Mambu needs.

## **One Last Thing**

**The night before, remind yourself:**
> "I'm not trying to be perfect. I'm trying to be authentic, competent, and excited. That's enough."

**Good luck. You've got this.** 🚀
