# Final TMAU Script - Mambu Platform Engineer Position
**Speaker:** Hansen Nkefor
**Length:** 90 seconds
**Version:** Optimized with Recommendations

## **The Script - Enhanced Version (115 seconds)**

*"Thanks for speaking with me today. I'm really excited about what Mambu is building.*

*I bring nine years of cloud platform engineering with a differentiator that's increasingly valuable—I integrate AI into infrastructure automation and compliance. I built a system using LLMs to analyze AWS Config rules and CloudTrail logs, automatically identifying compliance drift and generating remediation steps. That reduced our audit prep time by 40% and provides predictive alerts for cost and security anomalies before they become incidents.*

*At Tambena, deployment times were slow and security reviews created bottlenecks. I redesigned our CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Terraform, embedding automated security scans and compliance verification directly into each deployment. The result—50% faster deployments while strengthening our security posture. The team shifted from manual, high-stress releases to a fully automated process they could trust.*

*What I learned is that the best platform engineering isn't about the fanciest tools—it's about understanding developer psychology. When developers trust your platform catches issues before production, they actually move faster because they're not second-guessing themselves. That shift from 'the platform is a bottleneck' to 'the platform is my safety net' is what I optimize for.*

*I'm drawn to Mambu because you're solving something I care about deeply—financial inclusion. Coming from Cameroon, I've seen firsthand how traditional banking systems exclude billions of people. What excites me is how you've scaled from serving microfinance institutions to now empowering 260+ customers and 114 million end-users globally—from fintechs to top-tier banks. Your composable, cloud-native platform approach to democratizing banking technology isn't just innovative, it's necessary.*

*I've been thinking about the platform engineering challenges at your scale. Managing deployment velocity across 260+ customers while maintaining compliance across different regulatory jurisdictions—GDPR in Europe, data residency in APAC, varying financial regulations—that's not just technical, it's an orchestration challenge. Balancing 'move fast for fintechs who want weekly releases' versus 'maintain security for tier-one banks' is exactly the tension I find exciting.*

*What you'll get with me is someone who thinks beyond traditional DevOps. I've built production systems on AWS using EKS, Lambda, and Infrastructure as Code. I'm currently experimenting with eBPF for zero-instrumentation observability and exploring Crossplane for multi-tenant self-service infrastructure—both directly relevant to platform challenges at Mambu's scale. I view platform engineering as enabling developers to ship faster while maintaining security, and I know that only works when the platform team is seen as enablers, not gatekeepers.*

*I want to bring this mindset to Mambu—building platform infrastructure that's rock-solid, secure, and continuously improving. I'm curious—what's the platform engineering challenge keeping your team up at night right now?"*

## **Practice Checklist**

### **Before Interview:**
- [ ] Record yourself 3 times, watch for:
  - Filler words ("um", "like", "you know")
  - Speaking too fast (especially the Cameroon section AND the psychology insight)
  - Rushing through metrics
  - Sounding scripted when mentioning eBPF/Crossplane (should be conversational)
  - Final question should sound genuinely curious, not scripted
- [ ] Time yourself—Enhanced version: 110-115 seconds, 90-second version: 85-90 seconds
- [ ] Practice with someone who doesn't know your background (do they understand it?)
- [ ] Test in front of a mirror (check facial expressions, especially during the final question)
- [ ] Practice transitioning from your script into dialogue after the final question

### **Day Of:**
- [ ] Review script 2 hours before (not right before—you'll sound robotic)
- [ ] Do vocal warm-ups (hum, tongue twisters)
- [ ] Remind yourself: "This is a conversation, not a performance"
- [ ] Review Mambu's latest blog posts or press releases (shows you're current)
- [ ] Prepare to elaborate on eBPF/Crossplane if asked

---

## **Situational Adaptations**

### **Which Version to Use:**

**Use Enhanced Version (115s) if:**
- Phone screen or video interview (more time available)
- They say "Tell me about yourself" with no time constraint
- You sense they value strategic thinking
- The interviewer seems engaged and thoughtful

**Use 90-Second Version if:**
- In-person interview (time is precious)
- They say "Give me a quick overview"
- Multiple people in the room (shorter is better)
- Early-stage screening call

### **If They Seem Technical-Focused:**
**Expand the eBPF/Crossplane section:**
> "I'm currently experimenting with eBPF for zero-instrumentation observability—the ability to gather deep kernel-level metrics without modifying application code is powerful for multi-tenant environments. I'm also exploring Crossplane for self-service infrastructure, allowing teams to provision cloud resources through Kubernetes CRDs while maintaining centralized governance. Both are directly relevant to platform challenges at Mambu's scale."

### **If They Seem Mission-Focused:**
**Expand this section:**
> "Coming from Cameroon, I've seen how lack of access to financial services keeps people trapped in poverty. What draws me to Mambu is your journey—you started with microfinance institutions and scaled to serve 260+ customers and 114 million end-users globally. You're enabling everyone from fintechs and telcos to top-tier banks to build modern banking solutions. The fact that my platform engineering work could help scale infrastructure that democratizes access to banking technology—that's powerful and personal to me."

### **If They Seem Strategy-Focused:**
**Expand the orchestration challenge section:**
> "I've been thinking about the platform engineering challenges at your scale. Managing deployment velocity across 260+ customers while maintaining compliance across different regulatory jurisdictions—GDPR in Europe, data residency requirements in APAC, varying financial regulations—that's not just technical, it's an orchestration challenge. You're essentially running a platform that needs to be both highly standardized for operational efficiency AND highly flexible for diverse customer needs. I imagine there's constant tension between 'move fast for fintechs who want weekly releases' versus 'maintain security and compliance for tier-one banks who need quarterly release cycles.' That's the kind of complexity that excites me."

### **If Time is Extremely Tight (60 seconds):**
**Use this ultra-condensed version:**
> "I bring nine years of cloud platform engineering, integrating AI into infrastructure automation—reducing audit prep by 40%. At Tambena, I redesigned CI/CD pipelines, achieving 50% faster deployments while strengthening security. What I've learned: the best platform engineering shifts teams from seeing platforms as bottlenecks to seeing them as safety nets. I'm drawn to Mambu because of your impact—260+ customers, 114M end-users—democratizing banking technology. Coming from Cameroon, financial inclusion is personal to me. I view platform engineering as enabling developers to ship faster while maintaining security. What's the platform challenge keeping your team up at night right now?"

### **If They Interrupt with Questions:**
**Don't panic. Common interruptions:**
- **"Tell me more about the AI system"** → Great! They're interested. Dive deeper.
- **"What's eBPF/Crossplane?"** → Brief explanation, then tie back to Mambu's needs.
- **"What was the Tambena tech stack?"** → Answer directly, then ask: "Should I continue or would you like to dive deeper here?"
- **"Where in Cameroon?"** → Answer warmly, show personality, then transition back: "That background is actually why I'm so excited about Mambu's mission..."
- **"What problem do YOU think we're facing?"** → Perfect! Your orchestration challenge framing answers this. Elaborate.

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

| **Mistake** | **Why It Hurts** | **Fix** |
|-------------|------------------|---------|
| Speaking too fast | They can't absorb information | Pause after each metric AND each insight |
| Sounding scripted | Seems inauthentic | Vary your wording slightly each practice |
| Over-explaining AI | Loses non-technical interviewers | Keep it at current level unless asked |
| Underselling Cameroon story | This is your most memorable part | Slow down, make eye contact |
| Name-dropping tech without context | Sounds like resume recitation | eBPF/Crossplane should connect to Mambu's needs (NEW) |
| Making final question sound rhetorical | Breaks the dialogue transition | Pause, maintain eye contact, genuinely invite response (NEW) |
| Over-explaining orchestration challenge | Can sound presumptuous | State it briefly unless they engage (NEW) |
| Rushing through "safety net" insight | One of your most unique points | Slow down, let it land (NEW) |
| Sounding arrogant about knowing their problems | Can backfire | Use "I imagine" not "I know" (NEW) |

## **Post-Script Transitions**

After you finish, expect these follow-up questions:

### **"Tell me more about the AI compliance system"**
**Response:**
"Absolutely. We were spending weeks preparing for audits—manually reviewing IAM policies, S3 bucket configurations, encryption settings. I built a system that uses GPT-4 to analyze our AWS Config snapshots and CloudTrail logs, comparing them against our internal compliance policies and frameworks like SOC 2 and ISO 27001. It generates a detailed report with specific remediation steps—for example, 'S3 bucket X has public read access, recommend applying policy Y.' It's cut our audit prep from 3 weeks to under 2 weeks, and the auditors actually trust the output because it cites specific AWS Config rules."

### **"How did you handle resistance to the CI/CD changes?"**
**Response:**
"Great question. Initially, the security team was concerned we were moving too fast. I brought them into the design process early—showed them how we were embedding SAST scanning, DAST testing, and compliance checks at every stage. I also built a 'break-glass' process so they could still do manual reviews for high-risk changes. Once they saw the pipeline catch issues earlier than they ever did manually, they became advocates."

### **"What do you mean by 'safety net vs bottleneck'?"** (NEW)
**Response:**
"When developers see the platform as a bottleneck, they try to work around it—shadow IT, manual deployments, shortcuts. But when they see it as a safety net—something that catches issues before production, provides guardrails without slowing them down—they actually lean into it. They deploy more confidently and more frequently. At Tambena, once developers trusted the automated security scans would catch issues they might miss, they stopped second-guessing every deployment. Our deployment frequency actually increased while our incident rate decreased. That psychological shift is what I design for."

### **"Tell me about eBPF and Crossplane—why those specifically?"** (NEW)
**Response:**
"They both address challenges I imagine Mambu faces. eBPF allows deep observability without instrumenting every application—critical when you're running infrastructure for 260+ customers with different tech stacks. You can't ask every customer to modify their code for observability. Crossplane addresses self-service infrastructure in a multi-tenant environment—teams can provision what they need through Kubernetes CRDs while you maintain centralized governance and cost controls. Both solve the 'how do we give teams autonomy while maintaining control' problem that platform engineering at scale requires."

### **"What makes you think we have that orchestration challenge?"** (NEW)
**Response:**
"I could be wrong—I'd love to hear what you're actually facing. But from the outside, serving both neo-banks who need to move fast and tier-one banks with strict compliance requirements on the same platform seems like it would create interesting tensions. One customer wants to deploy three times a week, another wants quarterly release cycles with extensive testing. Both need to be right for their context. That's not a technical problem you can just engineer away—it's about platform design that accommodates both models. Is that accurate, or are the challenges different?"

### **"Why Mambu specifically?"**
**Response:**
"Three reasons. First, your SaaS platform approach to banking infrastructure is exactly where I think the industry needs to go—composable, cloud-native, API-first. You're providing core banking, lending, deposits, and payment solutions that are agile and designed for rapid deployment. That requires rock-solid platform engineering. Second, financial inclusion is personal to me. The fact that you started with microfinance institutions and now serve 260+ customers globally—from fintechs and telcos to top-tier banks—reaching 114 million end-users, shows you're making real impact at scale. And third, from researching your engineering culture, I can see you're solving complex platform challenges—multi-tenancy, compliance across jurisdictions, high availability—those are problems I've solved and want to keep solving."

### **"What would you do in your first 90 days?"** (NEW - if they ask)
**Response:**
"Three phases. First 30 days: Listen and learn. I'd embed with engineering teams, attend standups, understand pain points firsthand. I'd review deployment metrics, incident reports, and talk to the platform team about what's working and what's not. Days 30-60: Identify one high-impact automation opportunity—maybe improving rollback confidence, maybe streamlining compliance checks for new integrations—something that demonstrates value while I'm still learning your systems. Days 60-90: Deliver that win and build trust. Then I'd be ready to tackle bigger initiatives with credibility and context. The key is building relationships and understanding before proposing solutions."

## **Handling the Response to Your Final Question**

After you ask "What's the platform engineering challenge keeping your team up at night right now?", here's how to handle their response:

### **If They Share a Specific Problem:**
**Do:**
- ✅ Listen actively (nod, maintain eye contact)
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions to show genuine interest
- ✅ Connect it to your experience if relevant ("That's interesting—at Tambena we faced something similar...")
- ✅ Offer a thoughtful observation or insight (not a full solution)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Immediately jump to "here's how I'd solve it" (too presumptuous)
- ❌ Say "that's easy" or minimize the problem
- ❌ Interrupt them while they're explaining

**Example Response:**
> "That's fascinating—the multi-region compliance challenge with data residency. At Tambena, we dealt with HIPAA compliance across multiple states, but I imagine adding GDPR and APAC requirements multiplies the complexity significantly. How are you currently handling the balance between data locality and operational efficiency?"

### **If They Deflect or Say "Everything's Fine":**
**Do:**
- ✅ Acknowledge positively
- ✅ Pivot to asking about future initiatives
- ✅ Show curiosity about their roadmap

**Example Response:**
> "That's great to hear. What about on the innovation side—are there any new platform capabilities the team is excited about building in the next 6-12 months?"

### **If They Turn It Back to You:**
**Example:** "Well, what do YOU think our biggest challenge is?"

**Response:**
> "Based on my research and what I shared earlier—the orchestration challenge of serving diverse customer needs at scale—I'd be curious if that resonates. But I'm sure there are internal challenges I wouldn't see from the outside. What's top of mind for you?"

---

## **Final Confidence Boosters**

1. **You have a genuinely unique story.** Not many platform engineers have your combination of:
   - AI integration into infrastructure
   - Regulatory/compliance experience (healthcare → fintech)
   - Authentic personal connection to mission (Cameroon → financial inclusion)
   - Systems thinking ("safety net vs bottleneck")
   - Strategic understanding of Mambu's specific challenges

2. **Your metrics are real and defensible.** 40% audit reduction, 50% faster deployments, $10K savings—these aren't inflated numbers. You can back them up.

3. **You've thought about THEIR problems, not just YOUR accomplishments.** Most candidates talk about what they've done. You've demonstrated understanding of what Mambu faces. That's rare.

4. **Your insights are memorable.** "Safety net vs bottleneck," "orchestration challenge," "enablers not gatekeepers"—these are phrases interviewers will remember and quote in debrief meetings.

5. **You end with curiosity, not desperation.** Ending with a question shows confidence—you're evaluating mutual fit, not just trying to get hired.

6. **This is a conversation.** If you forget a line, just have a conversation. They want to know you, not hear a perfect recitation. Your insights are strong enough to carry you.

7. **You belong here.** You have 9 years of experience, you've solved real problems at scale, you're continuously learning (eBPF, Crossplane), and you care deeply about the mission. That's exactly what Mambu needs.

---

## **One Last Thing**

**The night before, remind yourself:**
> "I'm not trying to be perfect. I'm trying to be authentic, competent, curious, and excited. That's enough."

**Three mantras for the interview:**

1. **"They're evaluating fit, not perfection."** Your job is to show who you are and how you think, not to have all the answers.

2. **"My insights are my differentiator."** The "safety net vs bottleneck" framing, the orchestration challenge observation, the enabler mindset—these are unique to you. Trust them.

3. **"Curiosity is confidence."** Ending with a question isn't weakness—it's showing you're here to solve problems, not just get a job.

**Good luck. You've got this.** 🚀
